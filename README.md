## General Info
This is my first attempt at making a full website (albeit with limitied functionality) using HTML, CSS, and SASS. This is a winery website that is mobile responsive and uses CSS grid & flexbox. The goal of this project was to test out my Web Design skills using HTML and SASS. Along the way I learned alot about using the CSS Flexbox and Grid and when it is best appropriate to use them.

## What I Learned
This is my attempt at making a full front-end website using just HTML and CSS. This project was quite challenging for me but I enjoyed learing how to use CSS features such as grid & flexbox. I also learned how important it is to resize images when necessary for performance, something I haven't really considered before. I especially came to value how crucial it is to build projects in order to really learn in depth about each programming language being used.
