## General Info
I created a mockup of the landing page for https://oneillwine.com/. I wanted to try and replicated a webpage that I thought would really challenge my skills and knowledge of HTML, CSS, and I learned more about using SASS on my projects. I still have a long way to go but I am feeling more and more confident as I learn more skills.
